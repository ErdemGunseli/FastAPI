# <!!!> GET HTTP REQUEST METHOD (READ) <!!!>

# Need FastAPI to recognise that this is an endpoint - the point where clients will interact with the application.
# An endpoint is like a function that returns something to a client using a URL.
# Async function means that it can run concurrently with other code,
# allowing the program to perform other tasks while waiting for operations to complete.
# The 'await' keyword is used to tell the program to wait for the operation to complete before continuing.

# The decorator argument refers to the URL path that will trigger the function.
# This function will be associated with the  URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/books.
@app.get("/books")
async def read_all_books():
    # The function returns the dictionary BOOKS.
    # This will be converted to JSON format and returned to the client.
    return BOOKS


# Notice that the decorator argument of the above function is a static path.
# Dynamic path parameters allow us to change the URL path of the endpoint depending on the value of an argument.

# If we have a function that leads to "books/{title}", then the title argument can be used to change the URL path.
# But underneath this function, we would not be able to have a function that leads to "books/mybook" since
# the above function would be called first. This is because FastAPI will always look for the first function
# that matches the URL path.
# To avoid this, we can ALWAYS have the static path above the dynamic path in the code.


# URLs cannot have spaces, and the %20 is a URL encoding for a space. For example, "books/The%20Hobbit".


# THe identifier of the dynamic parameter must match the parameter of the function:
@app.get("/books/{book_title}")
async def read_book(book_title: str):
    # Linear searching the dictionary of books:
    result = []
    for book in BOOKS:
        # The case fold method compares the strings without considering their case.
        # It is more aggressive than the lower method, because it removes distinctions in uppercase/lowercase
        # including special characters that are not in ASCII.

            result.append(book)

    for book in BOOKS:

            result.append(book)
    return result


# The same endpoint can be written using query parameters by simply removing '{author}'

# Query parameters are key-value pairs appended to the end of a URL, after a "?" and separated by "&".
# They provide additional information to the server such as filters and sorting criteria.
# FastAPI knows that anything passed after "/books/" that is not a dynamic path parameter - it is a query parameter.

        if book.get(CATEGORY).casefold() == category.casefold():

# Path parameters & query parameters can be used simultaneously:
@app.get("/books/{author}/")
# In the following example, 'category' is automatically detected as a query parameter
# since it is not explicitly used in the path:
